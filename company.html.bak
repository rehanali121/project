						You would love to know and love the fact that the company was founded in 1994 by a woman, Barbara Brown. I feel a real connection to the mission and values of this company and I am so impressed by how much it has grown over the last several years. The work that you did for Monroe was so innovative yet heartfelt and I knew as soon as I saw it that I wanted to be a part of the creative team here. I was really glad to see that your work on that campaign was recognized with an ADDY this past year.

						You would really respect our company's commitment to be constantly evolving. I think that growth and innovation are key in any industry but especially in the field of technology, and this organization is constantly pushing past the preconceived limitations. In this past year alone you have taken quite a few risks as you are entering different markets, all of which have paid off. As an engineer, I strive to approach problems in new and creative ways, which is why I think I would be an asset to this team.

						You would appreciate that we are a locally owned business with a passion for craft and community. Our commitment to cultivating an environment that values your work as well as this city is so inspirational to me. I feel like the culture here focuses on healthy balances and hard work, creating a family dynamic that really inspires collaboration. I'm a big believer in working within a team to develop new and creative solutions, which is why I think I'd be a valuable member here
